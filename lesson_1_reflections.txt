How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It was very useful to be able to compare the two versions without needing to manually go through it. The FC command is a key tool.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	May not do it often enough, or do it too often and it becomes cluttered. More so the first.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	type in git log to see all of the commits. type in git diff commit1 commit2 to see their differences

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	it generates an e mpty one for whatever directory you are in. This is necessary to create a sort of big file to contain stuff in
	do this using "git init" and "git status"
