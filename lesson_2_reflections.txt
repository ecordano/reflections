What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	it generates an e mpty one for whatever directory you are in. This is necessary to create a sort of big file to contain stuff in
	do this using "git init" and "git status"

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	the staging area is needed as an intermediary between the files in your directory and making commits to a repository. You can use "git add" to add one or multiple files to the area to be committed at one time
